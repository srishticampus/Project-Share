# **Project Share**

**Abstract**

ProjectShare is an innovative collaborative project and idea marketplace designed to bridge the gap between individuals with creative ideas and those with the skills to bring them to life. Many individuals struggle to find the right collaborators due to a lack of resources and connections. ProjectShare addresses this challenge by providing a structured platform where users can connect, collaborate, and manage projects efficiently.

The platform caters to four key user groups: Project Creators, who can post project ideas, define required skills, and manage collaborator applications; Collaborators, who can browse and apply for projects that align with their expertise while building a portfolio of completed work; Mentors/Experts, who can offer guidance, provide feedback, and contribute to project discussions; and Admins, who are responsible for user management, content moderation, and platform analytics.

Key features of ProjectShare include skill-based matching, ensuring project creators find the right talent; basic project management tools, such as task lists and progress tracking; portfolio building, allowing collaborators to showcase their contributions; and mentorship opportunities, fostering knowledge-sharing and professional growth. The platform also promotes idea sharing and feedback, creating a dynamic environment for innovation.

By integrating seamless communication, project tracking, and collaboration tools, ProjectShare empowers individuals to transform ideas into successful projects. With a strong emphasis on usability, security, and community engagement, ProjectShare aims to become a leading platform for project development and innovation across various industries.

## **Existing System & Its Disadvantages**

The current methods for finding project collaborators and managing projects include:

* Social Media & Networking Platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook Groups, Reddit, Discord)

  * No structured matching or filtering based on skills.

  * Collaboration relies on direct messaging with no built-in project management.

* Freelance Marketplaces (Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer)

  * Focused on paid gigs rather than equity-based or learning-driven collaborations.

  * Transactional, not suitable for long-term projects.

* University & Community Networks (Hackathons, Campus Forums, Meetups)

  * Limited to specific timeframes and locations.

  * Lack of sustained collaboration after events.

* Manual Outreach & Personal Connections (Emails, Word-of-Mouth)

  * Finding collaborators is slow, unstructured, and inefficient.

  * No assurance of finding the right expertise.

* Disconnected Project Management Tools (Slack, Trello, Asana, Google Drive, GitHub)

  * Teams use multiple platforms, making coordination complex.

  * No centralized system to track project progress and communication.
